# NumPy
NumPy is a linear algebra library for Python. It is incredibly fast because it binds to the C libraries, and it allows programmers to utilize vectorization techniques to do operations.

# NumPy Arrays
Arrays are the main way we use NumPy. They come in two flavors:
- Vectors
- Matrices

Vectors are strictly 1D Arrays, and Matrices are 2D (however, matrices can still have only one row or only one column).

# Installation
Use ```pip install numpy``` or if you have Anaconda (recommended) use ```conda install numpy```
